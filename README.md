# Multi-Agent Systems Supply Chain Simulation
This project is a multi-agent system simulating the supply-chain manufacturing process of smartphones.
The system is implemented in JADE, and a copy of jade.jar must be added to the project classpath to enable it to run (this can be downloaded from the JADE website.)
